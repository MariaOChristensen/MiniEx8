Instead of selecting one of Shiffman's coding challenges I choose one of my own programs - Mini Ex 4, Pepper Steak - because I thought it could be a fun challenge to view something personal through an optic lens, and to create a flowchart of a program that is neither linear nor has an end to it.

The proram itself can be found here: https://cdn.rawgit.com/MariaOChristensen/MiniEx4/gh-pages/Mini%20ex%204/index.html
And the repository with the code is here: https://github.com/MariaOChristensen/MiniEx4

Despite having tried to create a flowchart before, it was still really difficult to do because you constantly have to have almost all the functions in mind when you take the next step. I had particular issues in the "button turns green" area because that is something that can happen any time during the program, so to visualize it through a flowchart which is very step-by-step-based was tough, but I think I sort of made it work.
Another difficulty was to compose the flowchart and make it look clean and manageable. The more steps you have, the easier it can turn into a mess. I used Word to make my flowchart, and it does look a little messy, but if you focus on one step at a time I think it is understandable.

Flowcharts are good at breaking processes down to the tiniest details, but in a readable language. I think the arrows are the most important elements in a flowchart, apart from the text, of course, as they guide people through the process. Because it is so objective and -more or less - precise, it can communicate ideas to a large group of people better than if a person explained it to them. I see flowcharts as skeletons, so they cannot stand on their own in a project, but work as a solid to-do list of what processes the project must contain.
